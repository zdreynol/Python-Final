# Python-Final
#This repository was designed for my Python Final Project and focuses on Object Recognition and Displaying coordinates on a plot. 
#The required files have been added and can be found in the FilesForProject folder. 
#Here is the Youtube Link for the video required for this project: https://youtu.be/pLXwIHr7kgA
# Even though it is hard to see in the video, The plot that displays the squads pathing has a grid. Due to the quality of the video it is hard to see.
Thank you!
